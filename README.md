### State-Machine Based Optimizer for AntennaCAT 
This on-going collection of objective functions pulled from popular literature for testing optimizers has 60+ objective functions with 
documented solution space, decision space, and objective space with Pareto Front associated with Topsakal Lab. These optimizers integrate with the AntennaCAT project. 
AntennaCAT is a comprehensive implementation of machine learning to automate, evaluate, and optimize the antenna design process using 
EM simulation software. It utilizes a combined antenna designer and internal calculator to accelerate the CAD construction and 
EM simulation of several common topologies, while eliminating model disparity for automated data collection. Forked from LC-Linkous.

See the [Topsakal Lab README](https://github.com/Topsakal-Lab) or [LC-Linkous's README](https://github.com/LC-Linkous) for more information
